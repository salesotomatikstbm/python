# Python Homework

This weekâ€™s assignment: practice Python to improve your typing and coding skills. Use VS Code and create the files below. Run each program and check the output.

## Program 1
Create a file named `program1.py` and enter:
```python
print("About Me")
print("My name is Ramesh.")
print("I am studying in 7th standard at ABC School.")
print("I live in Madambakkam.")
print("My father's name is Kumar.")
print("My mother's name is Vasantha.")
print("I like chocolate and ice cream.")
print("I enjoy reading storybooks.")
print("My favorite subject is Mathematics.")
print("I have a pet dog named Bruno.")
print("I like playing cricket with my friends.")
print("I want to become an engineer when I grow up.")
```

## Program 2
Create a file named `program2.py` and enter:
```python
name = "Ramesh"
standard = "7th"
school = "ABC School"
city = "Madambakkam"
father_name = "Kumar"
mother_name = "Vasantha"
favorite_food1 = "chocolate"
favorite_food2 = "ice cream"

print("About Me")
print(name)
print(standard)
print(school)
print(city)
print(father_name)
