## **Project 2: Simple ATM Simulator** 🏦

### **Objective:**

Use **arithmetic + decision making** to simulate ATM transactions.

### **Requirements:**

1. Start with an **initial balance** (e.g., `5000`).
2. Show menu to the user:

   * 1 → Deposit Money
   * 2 → Withdraw Money
   * 3 → Check Balance
   * 4 → Exit
3. Use `if-else` or `match-case` to handle options.
4. For withdrawals:

   * Check if balance is enough.
   * If not enough → show "Insufficient Balance".
5. Keep the ATM running in a **loop** until user chooses Exit.

Example flow:

```
Welcome to ATM
1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Balance
4. Exit
Choose option: 2
Enter amount: 3000
Transaction successful! Remaining balance = 2000
```
