### **Project 1: Advanced Student Grade Analyzer** 🎓

### **Objective:**

Use **operators, conditions, averages**, and **switch-case** to analyze student marks, assign grades, and provide detailed reports with additional calculations.

1. Take input for **5 subject marks** from the user.
2. Calculate:

   * **Total Marks**
   * **Average Marks**
   * **Percentage**
   * **Highest and Lowest Marks**
3. Assign a **Grade** based on percentage:

### **Project 2: Enhanced ATM Simulator** 🏦

### **Objective:**

Simulate **ATM transactions** with the use of **arithmetic, decision making**, and **switch-case** to handle different options and ensure better transaction security.

### **Requirements:**

1. Start with an **initial balance** (e.g., `5000`).
2. Show a menu to the user with multiple options:

   * **1** → Deposit Money
   * **2** → Withdraw Money
   * **3** → Check Balance
   * **4** → Transfer Money to Another Account
   * **5** → Exit
3. Use **switch-case** (or **match-case**) to handle options.
4. For withdrawals and transfers:

   * Check if balance is enough.
   * If not enough → show "Insufficient Balance".
5. Implement **transaction security** with a PIN code that the user must enter before making any transaction.
6. Keep the ATM running in a **loop** until the user chooses to Exit.
