# **Assignment 01: Practicing Arithmetic Operators** ➕➖✖️➗

We will practice using **arithmetic operators** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`) to work with numbers.

## **Objective:**

Learn how arithmetic operators work in Python by applying them to simple fruit-related problems.

## **Tasks:**

1. Create two variables:

   * `apples = 10`
   * `mangoes = 4`
2. Use arithmetic operators to:

   * Find the **total fruits** (addition).
   * Find the **difference** (subtraction).
   * Find the **double apples** (multiplication).
   * Find the **apples per basket if divided into 2 baskets** (division).
   * Try **modulus (`%`)** to see if fruits divide evenly.
   * Try **power (`**`)** to square a number.

## **Think About:**

* What happens when you divide and the result is not whole?
* When would modulus (%) be useful in real life (e.g., sharing fruits)?

# **Assignment 02: User Input with Operators** ⌨️

Now let’s use **user input** to apply operators.

## **Objective:**

Learn how to take input from the user and apply operators to calculate results.

## **Tasks:**

1. Ask the user for **two numbers** (e.g., `x` and `y`).
2. Show the results of:

   * Sum (`x + y`)
   * Difference (`x - y`)
   * Product (`x * y`)
   * Division (`x / y`)
   * Compare which is greater (`x > y`, `x < y`)
   * Check if they are equal (`x == y`)

## **Think About:**

* What happens if the user enters 0 for `y` and you try to divide?
* How do integer vs decimal inputs change results?

# **Assignment 03: Even or Odd Checker (If-Else)** 🔢

Use **if-else** to check if a number is even or odd.

## **Objective:**

Understand how conditions and `%` operator work in decision-making.

## **Tasks:**

1. Ask the user for a number.
2. If the number is divisible by 2 → print `"Even Number"`.
3. Otherwise → print `"Odd Number"`.

## **Think About:**

* What happens with negative numbers?
* What happens with zero?

# **Assignment 04: Grade Classifier (If-Elif-Else)** 🎓

Use **if-elif-else** to classify a student’s grade.

## **Objective:**

Practice decision-making with multiple conditions.

## **Tasks:**

1. Ask the user for marks (0–100).
2. Use conditions to classify:

   * 90 and above → `"Grade A"`
   * 75–89 → `"Grade B"`
   * 50–74 → `"Grade C"`
   * Below 50 → `"Fail"`

## **Think About:**

* What if the user enters more than 100 or less than 0?
* How can you add more grades like A+ or D?

# **Assignment 05: Temperature Advisor (If-Elif-Else with User Input)** 🌡️

Use **if-elif-else** with user input to give weather advice.

## **Objective:**

Combine user input with decision-making to provide different messages.

## **Tasks:**

1. Ask the user to enter the temperature (°C).
2. Use conditions to give advice:

   * Less than 15 → `"It’s Cold! Wear a jacket 🧥"`
   * Between 15 and 30 → `"Weather is Pleasant 🙂"`
   * More than 30 → `"It’s Hot! Stay hydrated 💧"`

## **Think About:**

* How would advice change for very extreme temperatures (e.g., 45°C or -5°C)?
* Can you extend it to show `"Rainy"` or `"Snowy"` with extra inputs?
