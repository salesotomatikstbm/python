## **Assignment 01: Beverage Temperature Classifier (Switch-Case)** 

### **Objective:**

Learn how to classify beverages based on their temperature using the **switch-case** statement.

### **Steps:**

1. **Ask the User for Beverage Temperature Input**:

   * Prompt the user to input the temperature of their beverage (in Celsius).

2. **Classify the Beverage Based on Temperature**:

   * If the temperature is **below 5°C**, print `"Your beverage is ice cold!"`.
   * If the temperature is between **5°C and 15°C**, print `"Your beverage is cool!"`.
   * If the temperature is between **15°C and 30°C**, print `"Your beverage is at room temperature."`.
   * If the temperature is **above 30°C**, print `"Your beverage is hot! Be careful."`.

### **Hints:**

* Use **`switch`** to match the temperature ranges and classify the beverage accordingly.
* Use **`default`** for unexpected or unclassified temperatures.

### **Task Concept:**

* **Switch-case** is used to categorize the temperature of beverages and print appropriate messages.
* This task helps practice decision-making based on temperature ranges using the **switch-case** statement.
