## **Assignment 01: Fruit Size Classifier (Switch-Case)** 

### **Objective:**

Learn to classify fruits based on their size using the **switch-case** statement.

### **Steps:**

1. **Ask the User for the Fruit Name**:

   * Prompt the user to input the name of a fruit (e.g., Apple, Orange, Grape, etc.).

2. **Classify the Fruit Size Using Switch-Case**:

   * If the fruit is **Apple** or **Orange**, print `"This is a medium-sized fruit."`.
   * If the fruit is **Watermelon**, print `"This is a large-sized fruit."`.
   * If the fruit is **Grapes**, print `"This is a small-sized fruit."`.
   * For any other fruit, print `"Unknown fruit size."`.

### **Hints:**

* Use **`switch`** to match the fruit name and classify the fruit size accordingly.
* Use **`default`** to handle unknown fruits.

   * If the day is **Monday**, print `"Start your week with a workout!"`.
