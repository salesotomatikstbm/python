## **Assignment 03: Electricity Bill Calculator (If-Else)**

### **Objective:**

To calculate the electricity bill amount based on the number of units consumed, apply different slab rates using **if-else conditions**, and display the total bill amount with a suitable message.

### **Instructions:**

1. Ask the user to enter the number of electricity units consumed.
2. Using **if-else conditions**, calculate the bill as per the rules below:

   * If units are **≤ 100**, cost = `units * ₹1`.
   * If units are **> 100 and ≤ 300**, cost = `100 * 1 + (units - 100) * ₹2`.
   * If units are **> 300**, cost = `100 * 1 + 200 * 2 + (units - 300) * ₹3`.
3. If the bill amount is more than **₹1000**, display: `"High usage! Please save electricity "`.
4. Otherwise, display: `"Thank you for saving electricity `.
5. Show the total units consumed and the final bill amount clearly.
