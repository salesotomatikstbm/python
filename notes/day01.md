# Student Onboarding

**Highlights**
- Asking for Student Information
- Understanding Student Motivation and Background

As each student arrived, I asked for their name, class, school, place of residence, and whether they had any prior knowledge of Python. I also asked them why they chose to join this class.

# Introduction to Python Programming

**Highlights**
- Explaining Software Requirements
- **Importance of Authentic Software Sources (Focus: Download Python only from the official website)**

At the beginning of the class, I explained the two essential pieces of software needed: Python and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  
**I emphasized only downloading and installing Python from the official website.**

---

# Environment Setup

**Highlights**
- Guided Installation of Python
- Creating the Project Folder Structure
- **Enabling File Extensions (Focus: Why showing file extensions matters)**

We began by installing Python. I asked students to search for "Python download for Windows" and guided them through selecting the official Python website.  
I personally handled each installation to avoid risks.  
I created a folder at:

```
C:\Users\Public\Documents\Python\Day01
```

Within this folder, I created a file named `hello.py` with this code:

```python
print("Hello")
```
I also enabled file name extensions in Windows to ensure students could easily identify their Python files.

# Testing the Installation

**Highlights**
- Running a Simple Python Program
- Verifying Installation via Command Prompt
- Introduction to Notepad for Coding

I opened the Command Prompt to check that Python was installed correctly.  
Students navigated to the new folder, and I demonstrated editing code using Notepad.  
This confirmed their installations were functioning.

# Maintaining Engagement

**Highlights**
- **Keeping Students Interested During Setup (Important: Tips for keeping energy high during configuration tasks)**

The setup process took about 30 minutes, and it was a bit challenging to maintain the students' enthusiasm.  
To keep them engaged, I explained each step, checked in on their progress, and encouraged questions as we worked.

# Self-Introduction: Code as Communication

**Highlights**
- Introducing Yourself in Python
- **Encouraging Personalization in Student Code (Focus: Letting students express themselves programmatically)**

After setup, I asked everyone to introduce themselves verbally. I shared how developers can do this in code, showing:
```python
print("My name is Ashok")
print("My age is 35")
print("I am a software architect with 15 years of experience")
print("I like programming languages")
print("I love teaching")
```
I then asked students to create their own versions in `hello.py`, encouraging self-expression through code.

# Setting Up Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

**Highlights**
- Installing VS Code
- Adding the Python Extension
- Opening Files and Running Code
- **Reinforcement Through Repetition (Important: Practicing the setup process more than once)**

I assisted each student in downloading and installing [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
We installed the Python extension, opened Python files, and practiced running their code in the console.  
Some students repeated the process multiple times for better understanding.

---

# Introducing Variables

**Highlights**
- Using Variables Without Formal Definitions
- **Hands-on Activity (Focus: Learning by Doing)**

I showed how to use variables without a formal explanation. For example:
```python
name = "Ashok"
school = "ABC School"
age = 8
student_class = "Grade 3: Section C"

print(name)
print(school)
print(student_class)
print(age)
```
Students tried a similar exercise, learning by doing rather than by theory.

---

# Review and Reflection

**Highlights**
- **Student Recap of the Lesson (Encouraging Peer Learning and Reflection)**
- **Encouraging Questions and Exploration (Focus: Building a Comfort Level With Errors and Curiosity)**

After the activity, students took a 5-minute break and then each summarized what they had learned.  
They also shared any questions, which encouraged a culture of curiosity and peer learning.

---

# Developing Coding Skills

**Highlights**
- **Importance of Daily Practice (Stress: Continuous, consistent practice is key)**
- Comfort With Laptop and Typing
- **Troubleshooting Errors Independently (Focus: Self-reliance and problem-solving mindset)**

I explained the keys to coding proficiency:
1. Getting familiar with using a laptop
2. Improving typing skills
3. Reading and solving errors independently

I stressed the need for daily practice and learning to solve errors on their own.

---

# Homework and Ongoing Support

**Highlights**
- Assignment Instructions
- How to Seek Help for Issues
- **Commitment to Practice Before Next Class (Emphasis: Responsibility and follow-up)**

I told students they would receive assignments to complete before next class.  
If they had trouble opening or running their code, they should message me immediately.  
I stressed that it is their responsibility to practice both coding and typing before the next session.

---

# Next Steps

**Highlights**
- Class Recap and Learning Outcomes
- Sharing Visual Aids (Screenshots)
- Distribution of This Week’s Assignment

Before the next class, I will:
- Send a recap of what was covered
- Provide screenshots (opening VS Code, navigating folders, creating a file, running code)
- Share this week’s assignment
