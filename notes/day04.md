## Warm-up & Recap

Today we will do two activities. Students must try to solve on their own. If you have any doubt or do not understand a question, please ask.

---

## Activity 1: School Supplies Adventure

**Objective:**
Organize your school supplies and practice simple math in Python.

**Step 1: Count Your Supplies**

* Ask: How many notebooks do you have? (use `input()` and `int()`)
* Ask: How many pens do you have? (same way as above)

**Step 2: Do Some Math**

* Find the total items you have. (use `+` operator)
* Check if you have more notebooks than pens. (use `if notebooks > pens:`)
* Check if notebooks are more than twice the pens. (use `if notebooks > 2 * pens:`)

**Step 3: Extra Simple Task**

* Print a short message about organizing supplies.

## Activity 2: Pocket Money Shopper

**Objective:**
Use your pocket money to check what school supplies you can buy.

**Step 1: Enter the Money & Prices**

* Ask: How much money do you have?
* Ask: How much does one notebook cost?
* Ask: How much does one pen cost?

**Step 2: Shopping Questions**

* Can you afford at least 1 notebook? (use `if money >= notebook_price:`)
* Can you afford 5 notebooks? (multiply price × 5)
* If you don’t have enough for even 1 notebook, print “Save more money!”

**Step 3: Extra Simple Task**

* Print a short message about shopping and planning money.

## Review & Reflection

Questions for discussion:

1. How did you compare the number of notebooks and pens?
2. How did you check if money was enough to buy items?
3. Why is it important to test different conditions in programs?

## Next Steps

In the next class, we will learn about the **switch-case statement**. This will help make programs cleaner when there are many conditions.
