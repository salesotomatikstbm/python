### **Objective:**

Buy notebooks and pens together, and check if your pocket money is enough.

### **Python Code Example:**

```python
# Big School Supplies Game

notebook_price = int(input("Price of one notebook: "))
pen_price = int(input("Price of one pen: "))
money = int(input("How much pocket money do you have? "))

notebooks = int(input("How many notebooks do you want? "))
pens = int(input("How many pens do you want? "))

# Calculate total cost
total_cost = (notebook_price * notebooks) + (pen_price * pens)
print("Final Bill:", total_cost)

# Compare with money
if money > total_cost:
    print("You can pay! Money left:", money - total_cost)
elif money == total_cost:
    print("You spent all your money!")
else:
    print("Not enough money. You need more:", total_cost - money)
```

### **Full Output Example:**

**Inputs:**

```
Price of one notebook: 20
