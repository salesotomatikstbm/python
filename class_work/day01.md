**Day - 03 - Class Flow** :

## Run Your First Program

```python
print("My name is Ashok")
print("My age is 35")
print("I am a software architect with 15 years of experience")
print("I like programming languages")
print("I love teaching")
```

# Introducing Variables
```python
name = "Ashok"
school = "ABC School"
age = 8
student_class = "Grade 3: Section C"

print(name)
print(school)
print(student_class)
print(age)
```
Students tried a similar exercise, learning by doing rather than by theory.
